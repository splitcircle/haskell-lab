#+TITLE: Haskell Notes

* Day One(ish?)
    Today I'm working through some excercism problems to grasp some basics

    - worth noting that while haskell can do type inference, it seems that the best practice is to include type signatures for just about everything. example:
      #+begin_src haskell
        foo :: Integer
        foo = 42
      #+end_src

    - worth noting that the type signature of a multi-argument is a bit unintuitive, at first(not objectively):
      #+begin_src haskell
        bar :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
        bar foo baz = foo + baz
      #+end_src
